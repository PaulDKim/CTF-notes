# What is SSRF? 
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate a web application into 
sending unauthorized requests from the server. This vulnerability often occurs when an application makes HTTP 
requests to other servers based on user input. Successful exploitation of SSRF can enable an attacker to access 
internal systems, bypass firewalls, and retrieve sensitive information.
